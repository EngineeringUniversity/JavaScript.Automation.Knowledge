# Current Status
>With no further communication by Andrews, userscript writers described the site as neglected and the official Greasemonkey site removed its front page link.[17][18] In response, script writers and other developers began working on the fork "openuserjs.org",[19][20] and later greasyfork.org,[21] as an immediate replacement.[22]
>
>In May 2014, userscripts.org became inaccessible on port 80, prompting users to access it on port 8080 instead.[16] In August 2014, the site was shut down completely. Most of its scripts were backed up to the static mirror userscripts-mirror.org where they can now be found.[16]
